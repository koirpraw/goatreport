# goatreport (Metriport App UI Clone)

I made this UI clone when i was working on another Fitness tracking app with a lot of similarities. I thought it would be a good idea to make a clone of the UI and use it as a template to help me with deciding UI/UX flow of the app.

This UI has a simple and minimal design with a lot of white space. It allows the user to clearly see the data and navigate through the app easily.

Since this is a fitness tracking app and deals with lots of data. Data visualization is a key part of the app.I have used similar charts, line graphs, doughnut charts, and bar graphs to visualize the data. Data visualization has a smooth animation and makes the app look more interactive. The animation effect and entire data visulaization is done using the [syncfusion_flutter_charts](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_charts) package.

The fitness tracking app i was working in is still in limbo but thought i would share this UI clone with the community.
